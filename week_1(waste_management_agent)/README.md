# Assignment One - Waste Management AI Agent
> *“We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.”* — Native Proverb 
<br>
I'm standing in the middle of nowhere, with waste scattered in every direction. People pass by, lost in their daily routines, without even noticing the piles around them. At the dump sites, dogs and crows fight desperately for scraps — a harsh reminder of survival in the filth. The air is heavy with a stench that chokes the lungs, and flies swarm endlessly.<br>
It makes me pause and ask: *what if Mother Earth herself is angry with us?* How long can she endure the scars we inflict on her? Even the grasses, buried beneath heaps of garbage, seem stressed and suffocated by our actions.<br>

But I believe we can change this. We have the ability — and the responsibility — to create a cleaner, more serene environment where fresh air flows freely and the earth feels alive again. <br>

That is why I built the waste-management-ai-agent. With just the type of waste a user provides, the agent responds with:

- the waste name,

- its level of harmfulness,

- safe disposal methods, and

- wealth-creation ideas from that very waste.

This project is my small step toward co-existing harmoniously with nature and protecting our planet from further harm. <br>

I invite you to join me in this journey — fork and clone this repo, and let’s build a system that not only manages waste but also restores balance with our mother earth.
