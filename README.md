# Generative AI with Jac Programming – 12 Week Seminar

Welcome to the official repository for the **12-week seminar on Generative AI and Jac Programming**, jointly offered by **The Open University of Kenya (OUK)** and **BCS Technology International Pty Limited, Australia**.

This program blends **cutting-edge AI theory** with **hands-on practice**, equipping learners with skills to design, build, and deploy **generative AI applications** across text, images, music, and video. The course is delivered by **AI PhDs and industry experts**, with a balance of **weekly tutorials, coding projects, and a final hackathon**.
